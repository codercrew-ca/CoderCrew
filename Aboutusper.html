				Our team works tirelessly to design new and innovative programmes that give students the best possible experience. That means: 
			<p>AN INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE: We give students real-time teaching and constant support, while using interactive digital tools like video calls, collaborative whiteboards, and screen sharing. What better way to learn about technology than to use it? </p>
			<p>	LEARN THROUGH PLAY: kids love our courses because they learn through play. Activities and games are included the sessions </p>
			<p>	EXCITING CONVERSATIONS: Kids are naturally curious. We love to prompt conversations that help them understand the world around us and develop critical thinking. We might look at examples of how modern companies use robots or wonder how Among Us got its shape. </p>
			 <p>	COLLABORATION: real human connection has been a big part of why kids enjoy classes. Through our sessions, we enable them to work in groups, collaborate and successfully deliver results  </p>
			<p>	A MASTERPIECE THEY MADE: We have a project-based pedagogy, meaning everyone who completes a course with us has something tangible that they created to share proudly with family and friends. </p>

			<p>At Coder Crew we aim to provide the best learning experience to a child, of the latest technology, helping them discover the numerous possibilities of problem solving using this technology and channelizing their abilities to create a working model of the solution.</p>
			<p>We aim to….</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>empower them with the ability of logical and critical thinking which would trump all academic skills going forward.</p></li>
				<li><p>provide an in-depth knowledge of technology starting with the basics which ensures a strong foundation to build on.</p></li>
				<li><p>give children the power of technology to bring their dreams to life and to awaken little minds to the numerous possibilities of problem solving.</p></li>
				<li><p>We believe that bringing in the fun element into learning helps retain their interest and motivates them to explore beyond their lessons.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>After all, Education is about helping children discover their ideas, giving them the tools to build and preparing them to launch themselves into the world of infinite possibilities.</p>
